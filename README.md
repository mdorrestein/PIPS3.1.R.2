# Function make_art

This function will allow you to create random art in R. Either you don't pick a color scheme, or you pick a color scheme based on the seasons of the year.

First, load the ggplot 2 package.

The function is as follows:

make_art(favorite_number, N, color)

# Arguments

By setting N, you determine the number of lines of your random art. Default = 15.

The default color scheme is all. If you want something else, choose either "spring", "summer", "fall", or "winter".
